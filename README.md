# Infodemiology

The Final Report (which can be viewed in its entirety here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/akong4110/Infodemiology/blob/main/Final%20Report.ipynb) is a record of the process from September 2020 to December 2020 of US sentiment towards self-induced abortion over the course of the past year [11/01/19 - 11/01/20]. The goal is to conduct trends analysis on future data in the beginning of 2021 to understand the interest trends of self-induced abortion related terminology and the potential trend influences of the covid pandemic.

The RSI_RSV_ACQUISITION (the Google Trends API key is intentionally excluded for legal reasons) contains the procedure taken to extract terms (and their relative search volume for top queries & relative search indexes for follow-up queries) from the Google Trends & Health Trends API. The algorithm's purpose is to document each query level for a given initial search term, ensuring to remove duplicates by updating the running log of acquired queries accordingly.

The Graphviz Tree Graphs demonstrates the creation of tree graphs for each term search's relative search indexes. Highlighted nodes were noted for either importance: relevancy to self-induced abortion or lack of follow-up terms.
