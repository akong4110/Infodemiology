# Infodemiology

The Final Report (which can be viewed in its entirety here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/akong4110/Infodemiology/blob/main/Final%20Report.ipynb) is a record of the process from September 2020 to December 2020 of US sentiment towards self-induced abortion over the course of the past year [11/01/19 - 11/01/20]. The goal is to conduct trends analysis on future data in the beginning of 2021 to understand the interest trends of self-induced abortion related terminology and the potential trend influences of the covid pandemic.
